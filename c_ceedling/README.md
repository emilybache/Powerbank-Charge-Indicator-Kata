C version of Powerbank Kata using Ceedling
==========================================

To run the tests:

    ceedling test:all

## Known Issues

- So far I haven't worked out how to get CLion to run these tests. I'm not sure if it can? See [this issue](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/CPP-27478/Support-Ceedling-in-CLion)
- [This issue](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Ceedling/issues/657) can be worked-around by using Ruby 3.0 (e.g. `rvm install 3.0`)
